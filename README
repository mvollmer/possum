POSSUM

Possum is an attempt at learning Python.  The idea is to replace
Scheme in the old, unknown, and unused Gossip Simulation Environment.
Thus, the following topics will be of interest:

 - How to do a very small domain specific language;
 - How to implement non-trivial data structures and algorithms;
 - How to glue C++ code into Python;
 - How to write documentation in Python land.
